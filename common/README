 This game is still under HEAVY development, so it will probably crash a lot
 and eat your savegames while at it, also, savegames WILL not work with future
 versions.

## Contributing
 WolkenWelten is Free Software and as such would greatly benefit from YOUR help,
 in whatever form that may come:

- writing documentation/manuals
- searching for bugs while playing
- drawing nicer sprites
- recording better soundeffects
- coding some cool features
- telling your friends about it

 Chances are, if you want, there is something for you to do to help this project
 come along :)

## Windows Requirements
 You need to be running at least Windows 7 64-bit, 32-bit versions are
 unsupported (if demand is high enough I might reconsider).

## MacOS Requirements
 You need to be running at least MacOS 10.10, apart from that everything should
 be included.

## Linux x86_64 Requirements
 For this to work you need SDL2, SDL2_mixer on your system, of
 course a libGL and running Wayland/X11 is also necessary. For the client you
 also  need glibc, although the server should run on any Linux machine.

## Linux ARM 64-bit Requirements
 This version needs SDL2, SDL2_mixer and glibc just as the x86 version, it is
 mostly tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB running Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit
 Beta. I also slightly overclocked my Pi to 2GHz CPU and 800MHz GPU making
 things  slightly smoother, although that should not be necessary.

## LISP commands
 You can press the tilde/~ key to pull down a nujel REPL. Here, whatevery you
 type will be evaluated, to evaluate an expression on the server you can use
 the (s) function which just passes everything on to the serverside and prints
 the result.

 Most functions are named similar to R5RS scheme which was used as a template,
 to find the more interesting routines that are custom to this game I would
 recommend just reading through the output of the (help) command, it can take
 a page number as an argument, and is also supported on the serverside.
