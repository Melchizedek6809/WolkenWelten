This project is NOT Free Software / Open Source!


You are not allowed to distribute it without explicit permission of the Author.

You are however free to look at, learn from, experiment with this code and
share YOUR modifications/patches to it as long as you make sure that you do not
inadvertently include code written by me.

Apart from that be careful about what you try with this codebase and which
commits to run, since there are unstable commits in the history that might harm
your machine and/or data for which I take no responsiblity for.

And last but not least, Happy Hacking! :)
