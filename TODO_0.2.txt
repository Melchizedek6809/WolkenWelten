- Check new GUI with a Gamepad
- Connecting to a non existant / wrong server should trigger an error message instead of an endless loop
- In-Game menu, so hitting ESC does not immediatly leave the server
- JetPack stamina/fuel
- Equipment and slots for Hook/JetPack/Glider
- At least one enemy (probably Beam Pylon)
- Replace Jumping SFX, they are annoying AF
