For some reason the starting position/rotation of the player is different when compiled using clang under linux as compared to gcc which hast the expected position/rotation, although the worldgen seems unaffected by this.
Sometimes weird horizontal green lines (T420), texture scaling? - still there t.K
Reducing Hook rope length still can lead to weird collision issues
You can't build one block wide bunkers, placing the block not possible.
Collision is getting weird in 1x2 mine shafts
itemDrops get lost if placing a block over them
Sometimes one spawns inside a block
sometimes the client segfaults, occurs more often when connected over the internet (sigPipe?)
Spawn bei login und sterben teilweise unterschiedlich
When a Server is already running, choosing singleplayer joins this server instead (Not Sure if truly bug)
