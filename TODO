- Make Assembly routines switchable during runtime for better performance comparison, as well as actual feature detection which mostly helps on x86 so we can switch between SSE/AVX
- Generate Cloud Density Mod based on chunk data BUT with a much lower resolution, basically summing together the amount of blocks inside a chunk and using that as a modifier for the clouddensity
- WorldSeeds should be anything, just sha1 the string
- Add Clouds Trails from Characters/Entities/Projectiles, probably looks nice
- SHRINK THE BLOCKS!
- Have Wind affect fire spread direction
- Complete Rewrite of the Water system, the current one is terrible
- Add block variations by having each face use a 2x2 texture, and instead of having uv be in the range of 0-1 use 0-0.5 for single blocks, thereby adding some slight variations along the way.
- Properly check if the server is still there and close the connection otherwise
- Make client detect when the connection to the server is separated and show an error instead of just becoming unresponsive
- Animals don't spawn after the limit has been reached, especially problematic if the limit is already reached with animals inside the spawn area which never gets freed
- Simulate/Store Oxygen levels in chunks and have it spread to neighboring chunks, trees/plants increase oxygen, fires/animals/players decrease oxygen
