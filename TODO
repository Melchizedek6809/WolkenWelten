- Make client detect when the connection to the server is separated and show an error instead of just becoming unresponsive
- Animals don't spawn after the limit has been reached, especially problematic if the limit is already reached with animals inside the spawn area which never gets freed
- Simulate/Store Oxygen levels in chunks and have it spread to neighboring chunks, trees/plants increase oxygen, fires/animals/players decrease oxygen
